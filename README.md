### Create a Tableau Cloud Trial
## Step 1: Create a Tableau Cloud Trial Site (Bailey)

### 1. Set Up Your Browser Windows

1. Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
2. Open **two windows side-by-side**:
   - **Window 1 (Standard)**: This should be your **regular browser window**, already signed into your **preferred email account** (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Salesforce email).
   - **Window 2 (Incognito/Private Mode)**: Open a **new incognito or private browsing window**:
     - In Chrome: Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
     - In Edge: Press `Ctrl+Shift+N`
     - In Firefox: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)

> **Why?** Using incognito mode ensures the Tableau trial sign-up process doesnâ€™t auto-login using any saved credentials.


### 2. Navigate to the Tableau Cloud Trial Page

In the **incognito window**, go to:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.tableau.com/products/trial](https://www.tableau.com/products/trial)


### 3. Fill Out the Trial Form

1. Complete the sign-up form with your details:
   - **First Name**
   - **Last Name**
   - **Company Name** â€“ The name of your organization.
   - **Email** â€“ Enter your preferred email address with a small modification:
     - Append `+TC25` just before the `@` symbol:
       - Example:  
         `john.doe+TC25@salesforce.com`  
         `tsmith+TC25@gmail.com`
   - **Phone Number** â€“ Your preferred phone number.
   - **Job Role / Department / Country** â€“ Fill these out as applicable.

2. Agree to the terms and click **Start Free Trial** (or the corresponding button).


### 4. Confirm Your Email

1. In your **standard browser window** (the one already signed in to your email):
   - Open your inbox and look for the confirmation email from Tableau (or Salesforce).
   - If you donâ€™t see it right away, check the **Spam**, **Promotions**, or **Updates** folders.

2. Click the **confirmation link** provided in the email to activate your trial.


### 5. Set Up Your Tableau Cloud Site

1. After clicking the confirmation link, you'll be taken to a site setup screen.
2. Choose the following:
   - **Site name** (this becomes part of your Tableau Cloud URL)
   - **Username and password**

3. Submit the form. Your Tableau Cloud trial environment will be provisioned â€” this usually takes 1â€“2 minutes.


âœ… **You're all set!** You now have a fully functional Tableau Cloud trial site ready to explore and use.
